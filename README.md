# Aleksy_Mi-ki_Prismatic
This is a repository of a game called Prismatic for MistyBytes

Game is about defending the object in the middle from incoming enemies using a player character moving around the object in the center. Currently working on adding more 
levels and thinking about the graphic side of the game, planning on adding power-ups, skin select, different level locations(each location would contain 10 levels).
This is a hyper casual game, with each level the speed of moving objects is increasing, this has an impact on game difficulty, to unlock next level
player has to survive full minute in the previous one.

Plans for this week:
-Add 20 levels (enemies are spawned randomly so its a quick job)
-Add 3 kinds of powerUps that Player can upgrade in the store for coins, the power ups are:
  - Add Lives - give player one extra life (on default there are 3)
  - Laser - Give player a temporary laser that destroys enemies
  - Shield - shields the player from incoming enemies
  - ? Set free - sets the player to move freely on the field for a few seconds
- Add example graphics to figma 
- Add example ui design
- create at least 2 different enemies (the movement on them is different, but with later locations they could stop moving 
towards the center and instead start randomly shooting at the player)
