This is a repository of a game called Prismatic for MistyBytes

Game is about defending the object in the middle from incoming enemies using a player character moving around the object in the center. Currently working on adding more 
levels and thinking about the graphic side of the game, planning on adding power-ups, skin select, different level locations(each location would contain 10 levels).
This is a hyper casual game, with each level the speed of moving objects is increasing, this has an impact on game difficulty, to unlock next level
player has to survive full minute in the previous one.
