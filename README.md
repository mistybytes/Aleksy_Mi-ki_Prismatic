# Aleksy_Mi-ki_Prismatic
This is a repository of a game called Prismatic for MistyBytes

Game is about defending the object in the middle from incoming enemies using a player character moving around the object in the center. Currently working on adding more 
levels and thinking about the graphic side of the game, planning on adding power-ups, skin select, different level locations(each location would contain 10 levels).
This is a hyper casual game, with each level the speed of moving objects is increasing, this has an impact on game difficulty, to unlock next level
player has to survive full minute in the previous one.

Difficulty increase:

There will be as many locations as colors of the rainbow and the same with enemies.
With each level enemies are going to get stronger and faster and so the player will have to buy upgrades in the shop.



Player will be able to unlock 6 weapons with each new location, they are already implemented
The weapons are:
 - classical blaster
 - blaster which freezes enemies in place
 - blaster that deals burn damage
 - blaster that speeds the player up and makes him fire faster but at a cost of lower damage
 - blaster that gives the player 1 extra life, but makes him slower
 - blaster that is able to transform enemies into coins
 - blaster that destroys every enemy and deals a lot of damage
 - blaster that can ricoshet from an enemy


Plans for this week:
- add the settings UI scene
- create some music for the game (will try)
- functional updates, testing, bug fixing
- simulating the game on mobile devices and making it so the resolution fits the screen 
- make the skin buttons functional
- make the info about daily rewards
- add the highscores on every level displaying amount of time survived
- add achievements
