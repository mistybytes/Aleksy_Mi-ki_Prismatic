# Aleksy_Mi-ki_Prismatic
This is a repository of a game called Prismatic for MistyBytes

Game is about defending the object in the middle from incoming enemies using a player character moving around the object in the center. Currently working on adding more 
levels and thinking about the graphic side of the game, planning on adding power-ups, skin select, different level locations(each location would contain 10 levels).
This is a hyper casual game, with each level the speed of moving objects is increasing, this has an impact on game difficulty, to unlock next level
player has to survive full minute in the previous one.

Difficulty increase:

There will be as many locations as colors of the rainbow and the same with enemies.
With each level enemies are going to get stronger and faster and so the player will have to buy upgrades in the shop.

The locations of the game could have specific effects asociated with them for example:
- slowing the player down
- poor lightning
- lightning in only one direction

Player will be able to unlock 6 weapons with each new location, they are already implemented

Locations are to be bought by the player by a specific amount, on location unlock the upgrades reset and a new weapon is unlocked.

Plans for this week:

- Add a save to a JSON and PlayerPrefs(currently working on it)
- finish the levels and gameplay so that it only needs graphics
- create some music for the game
