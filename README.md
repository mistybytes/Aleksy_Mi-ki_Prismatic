# Aleksy_Mi-ki_Prismatic
This is a repository of a game called Prismatic for MistyBytes

Game is about defending the object in the middle from incoming enemies using a player character moving around the object in the center. Currently working on adding more 
levels and thinking about the graphic side of the game, planning on adding power-ups, skin select, different level locations(each location would contain 10 levels).
This is a hyper casual game, with each level the speed of moving objects is increasing, this has an impact on game difficulty, to unlock next level
player has to survive full minute in the previous one.

Difficulty increase:

There will be as many locations as colors of the rainbow and the same with enemies.
With each level enemies are going to get stronger and faster and so the player will have to buy upgrades in the shop.

Plans for this week:

- Add example graphics to figma 
- Add example ui design
- Add a save to a JSON file and start testing the game for bugs
- Game is nearly finished all it needs is 3D models and UI design
- Test the game on a mobile device to see if there is somfing needed to be done with the layout
